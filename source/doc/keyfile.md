# keyfile

## Introduction
This library is a Nim reimplementation of [ethereum/eth-keyfile](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-keyfile), which is used to create and load Ethereum `keyfile` format and the tools for handling the format and for storing private keys. Currently, the library supports only the PBKDF2 method and does not support the Scrypt method.
